# AppointmentBook
For this project, I created a GitHub repository for an appointment booking system to manage and track changes efficiently. After setting up the repository, I cloned it locally and created a new branch dedicated to feature development. Using VSCODE, I wrote the code provided to us by the professor before pushing it to the remote repository on GitHub. I followed the process of creating a pull request, allowing my changes to be reviewed and merged into the main branch as stated in the step by step directions. I also started by defining an abstract class for appointments, ensuring a structured and scalable design. This helps in maintaining clean and reusable code, making future modifications and enhancements more manageable.
